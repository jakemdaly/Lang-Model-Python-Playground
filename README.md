# LangModelPythonPlayground
Basic environment for playing with the classes and interfaces of Berkley NLP assignment 1.

## Included
**LRRH.txt** - Little red riding hood story in text. Can use to train a small model and play around with the various interfaces and metrics <br>
**main.py** - Train and test your classes here <br>
**utils.py** - File containing a small subset of implementation utilities used in the Berkeley jar, which allow quick scripting and testing of the unigram model. Class interfaces are nearly identical to the Java implementation, so you can inheret parent classes to build fancier models, get them working in python, then transport them to Java with minimal overhead.
